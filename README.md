# Hello!

I'm Sierra Karst, a senior journalism student at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. 

At this point in my education, I've dabbled in about every form of journalism and digital commnications there is. Just to name a few of my favorite endeavors...
✨ Drone videography 
✨ Data journalsim (with spreadsheets and R)
✨ Depth-reporting and profile stories
✨ Graphic design
✨ Political reporting 
✨ Social media management

Mostly what I've found is that I'm curious, can ask the right questions, and am always ready for a new challenge.
